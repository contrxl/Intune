## Apps and Stuff for Intune

List of app deployment instructions for specific app installs. Deployments also contain detection rules or custom detection scripts where required.

## Additional Info

This repo only serves as guidance for deploying specific applications to Intune and assumes you have the required exisiting knowledge. If this is not the case, and this is new to you, information on getting started can be found on my Wiki [here](https://contrxl.gitbook.io/in-contrxl/). The "Intune" and "Learning Links" categories there should be of particular interest. The Wiki is updated regularly and release info can be found on the home page.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Wiki contains a wide range of information outside of the scope of Intune, all information is presented for educational purposes and should be used responsibly, in a controlled environment.
